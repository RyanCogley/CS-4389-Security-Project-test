# CS-4389-Security-Project
We are developing a secure digital e-commerce web application for PC games, inspired by platforms like Steam. Users can register, browse a catalog of games, view detailed game pages, and purchase titles securely. 

Next steps: We need to add a lot more pages for the front end, create the initial database, test cloud deployment, test the API integration, and ensure everything is connected/runs smoothly.

OS: Windows 10/11, Mac, Linux
Editor: VSCode 

Dependencies:
