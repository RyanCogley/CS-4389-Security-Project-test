# CS-4389-Security-Project
We are developing a secure digital e-commerce web application for PC games, inspired by platforms like Steam. Users can register, browse a catalog of games, view detailed game pages, and purchase titles securely. 
  
Next steps: We need to add a lot more pages for the front end, create the initial database, test cloud deployment, test the API integration, and ensure everything is connected/runs smoothly.  
  
OS: Windows 10/11, Mac, Linux  
Editor: VSCode 

Dependencies:  
FRONTEND  
npm install react-router-dom  
npm install -D tailwindcss@3 postcss autoprefixer  
npx tailwindcss init -p  
BACKEND  
pg, express, dotenv, cors, morgan, nodemon  

## How to run front-end code: 
1. Navigate to the root folder of the main branch on the repository
2. In your code editor of chioce run: npm install  
3. Then run: npm run dev  

Commands we used:  
npm install react-router-dom  
npm install -D tailwindcss@3 postcss autoprefixer  
npx tailwindcss init -p  
Next steps: We need to add a lot more pages for the front end, create the initial database, test cloud deployment, test the API integration, and ensure everything is connected/runs smoothly.  

## How to run backend code:
1. Navigate to the backend folder of the repository in your code editor of choice
2. Install JS dependencies pg, express, dotenv, cors, morgan, nodemon
3. Run: npm run devstart
4. Navigate to http://localhost:5000 to view the backend running in your browser

There is still much to implement here. This is just the framework of the backend system setup.


The current backend server url is: https://gamevault-backend-a1ce.onrender.com
/to use this API in a file use: import { *insertCommand* } from "../../api;
